temperature set to 293 (for assignment)
pressure set to assignment temperature

thermophysical properties:
transport set to Sutherland,
Cp, Cv set for dimensional

changed inlet temperature to: total temperature, gamma 1.4 and T0:
T0 = T + (u^2) / (2*Cp) (NOT YET SET, DO SO AFTER FINDING Ux)
Cp = 1005
T0 = 293 + (51.47^2)/(2*1005) = 294.3179904975124

find U:
M = 0.15
V_m = sqrt(gamma*R*T) = sqrt(1.4*287.052874*293) = 343.15 m/s
Ux = 51.47188067851222

changed total pressure at inlet:
p_tot = Ps + 1/2*rho*v**2
rho = 1.2047226972825444 (at this temp and pressure)
p_tot = 102920.86875

changed outlet bcondition to freestreamPressure, uniform value of pOut;
changed K:
U = 51.4718806
I = 0.01
k = (3/2)*(U*I)**2 = 0.39740317387509844

TO DO:
Re = 4e4
scaling:
Re = rho*v*l/mu
l = Re*mu/(rho*v)

added scaling file in system

find scaling for achieving Re:
l = 0.011697520654832238

transformPoints -scale '(0.011697520654832238 0.011697520654832238 1)'

changed omega to 1
